# Readme File
## Code
All the calculation codes can be found in **_Code_** folder. Inside the folder, _Energy_landscape.m_ and _Main.m_ are the two main functions. **_Functions_** contains all the preset_functions.

### **_Functios_**
Inside the **_Functions_** totally 22 preset functions are listed. All these functions can be called in costumized main function. 

### _Main.m_
This is the most basic main function used for trapping signal analysis. It has the capabilities of loading data, plotting a signal with a filter, selecting an interest period, calculating power spectral density, and fitting Lorentzian functions.

### _Energy_landscape.m_
This is the main function to calculate the energy landscape of a multiple-state signal, which contains a data loading process, probability distribution function generating, deconvolution process, and energy landscape calculation. 

## Data
There are three folders in the Data folder, which are _Conalbumin_with_iron_, _Conalbumin_without_iron_, and _Egg white_. They contain all the trapping data, which have already been converted from *.txt file to *.mat file.
